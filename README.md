# Carmine's Retribution
A fun and arcadey shoot-em-up style game, packed with satisfying sounds, visual effects, and gameplay. Travel through space as a flying rock and try to kill as many enemies as possible as fast as possible. But know that the game gets exponentially harder as time passes.

Use WASD to fly around and the spacebar to shoot and continue through menus.

## Future
Currently, the game is in a very early stage, but is still playable and fun. Eventually, I want to make this game into a more story-based game that plays more like Gradius, with roguelite elements like a shop and special upgrades to change the way you play later on during a game.
